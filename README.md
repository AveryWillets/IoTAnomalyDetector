# IoTAnomalyDetector

This project simulates a Data Center IoT service. The goal is to become familiar with analyzing sensor data for anomalies.

The project simulates sensor data describing temperature, humidity, and power consumption. It currently simulates data for 10 seconds, then outputs two logs: one for all data, and one for anomalies detected by the program.
These concepts could be expanded upon in an actual data center to include other types of sensors, dynamic data updates, time series analysis, and separate systems for generating and reading data.

The Mushroom Data Center project was written using C++ in the OnlineGDB IDE.
